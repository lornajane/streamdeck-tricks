I'm using https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier to run apps in their own windows so that switching to them doesn't raise ALL the firefox windows. However I need to add some keyboard hacks (I'm accessibility-challenged, and can't seem to package vimium with these apps) so those and the commands for building the apps live here.
